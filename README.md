# ü§ñ The Dream Team AI Chatbot ü§ñ

This project is a unique, persona-driven AI chatbot built with Python, Langchain, and Gradio. Instead of a generic assistant, this application allows users to "chat" with a panel of legendary figures from the world of computer science and embedded systems.

## ‚ú® The Dream Team

The AI adopts the persona of the figure most relevant to the user's question, providing expert and in-character responses. The team includes:

*   **[Dennis Ritchie]:** The father of C and UNIX.
*   **[Bjarne Stroustrup]:** The father of C++.
*   **[Michael Barr]:** An expert in embedded systems safety.
*   **[Jack Ganssle]:** A pragmatic expert in firmware and debugging.
*   **[Pete Warden]:** The pioneer of TinyML and AI on the edge.

This project demonstrates a powerful use of "system prompts" to create a sophisticated and engaging user experience.
